# loan_calculator
This is a loan calculator that I'm working on through the Jetbrains Academy lessons. 

There are alot of files in here outside of what I've written, as it includes many test files from Jetbrains Academy. The project file can be found in the following path - 
loan_calculator > Loan Calculator (1) > task > creditcalc

There are also coding challenges that I solved while working on this project. Those can be found in the following path - 
loan_calculator > Problems
